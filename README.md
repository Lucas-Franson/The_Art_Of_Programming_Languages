# The_Art_Of_Programming_Languages

This repository is a way to save my progress in the study of programming languages syntax and control my progress, my  purpose is to create a common project that I can replicate in several kind of programming languages and keep advancing in the concepts of each language.

## Programming Languages and the progress

- [ ] C#
- [ ] NodeJs
- [ ] Python
- [ ] C/C++

## Study Proposal

- Data Structure 
    - Abstract type of data
    - Linear structure of data (list, stack, queue, etc.)
    - Nonlinear structure of data (tree)
    - Methods of ordering intern and extern
    - Search Methods

- Programming Language
    - Types of data
    - Expressions
    - Logic operators
    - Sintaxe
    - Commands of input and output
    - Selection structure
    - Repetition structure
    - Composed variables (vector, matrix)
    - Functions and Procedures
    - Registry
    - Chain of Characters
    - Recursion
    - Pointers
    - Static and dynamic allocation
    - Files
